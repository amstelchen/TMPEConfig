# TMPEConfig

WIP.

This is currently only to test functionality of PySide6 and LXML, and also PyInstaller to work for multi-platform (Linux and Windows).

It makes use of GetFileVersionInfo from the Windows API to determine the version of TM:PE installed. On Linux, pefile is used instead.

It is likely to fail on any non-standard installations of Steam, or Python.

Don't expect the program to do something usable.

Please note, this project isn't affiliated or endorsed in any way by the develppers of either Cities: Skylines or TM:PE.
